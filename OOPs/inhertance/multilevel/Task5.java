// 5. Static Members in Multilevel Inheritance:
//    - Problem Statement: Create a multilevel inheritance structure with classes 'Company', 'Department', and 'Employee'. The 'Company' class should have a static attribute 'companyName' and a method 'showCompany()'. The 'Department' class should add 'departmentName', and the 'Employee' class should add 'employeeName' and 'employeeID'. Ensure proper initialization and use static members effectively.
